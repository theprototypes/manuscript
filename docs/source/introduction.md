# Introduction

The mix of professionals that a unit requires depends on its strategy.  Herein, and in line with Vermeulen's description, strategy

> _... involves a clear set of choices that define what [a] firm is going to do and what it’s not going to do_[^vermeulen]

Vermeulen's article notes that

> _... strategies fail to get implemented, despite the ample efforts of hard-working people, because they do not represent a set of clear choices.  Many so-called strategies are in fact goals._

Vermuelen's article includes succinct strategy examples.  Next, strategy options; roles in context.

## Options

* Test Laboratory
* Continuous Intelligence
* Machine Learning Model Development Services
  * Machine learning model dependent business operation: For example, (a) daily forecasts of precipitation levels per hour, 6 days ahead, (b) continuous forecasts of the blood glucose levels of intensive care unit patients, (c) automatic detection and classification of tumours in brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images.
  * Model development for robotic process automation systems: For example, a robotic process automation unit might request a model that automatically routes enquiries.
